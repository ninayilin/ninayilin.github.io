# Rawr: Advanced Pomodoro Timer

This project is a minimalist Pomodoro timer implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users stay focused by alternating work and break intervals while logging progress visually through tally marks on a notepad interface.

## Features

- Start, stop, and reset timer functions for 25-minute work sessions
- Optional short (5-minute) and long (15-minute) breaks
- Tally system that logs each start/stop action with a maximum of 35 tallies
- Tally layout wraps after every 15 characters for cleaner display
- Option to remove the most recent tally or clear all tallies
- UI designed for clarity and responsiveness

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rawr-pomodoro-timer.git

Tally marks are purely visual and do not persist across sessions
Button interactions are limited to a cap of 35 tallies for clarity
The timer does not include sound notifications by design
